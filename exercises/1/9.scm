; 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures
(load "_dependencies.scm")
; Exercise 1.9 
; Each of the following two procedures deÔ¨Ånes
;  a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the
;  procedures inc , which increments its argument by 1, and
;  dec , which decrements its argument by 1.
    (define (+ a b)
        (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
    (define (+ a b)
        (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
; Using the substitution model, illustrate the process gener-
; ated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5) . Are these
; processes iterative or recursive?
;  abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
;____________________________________________________________

; Note that `inc` wont be expanded, as per the substitution model to not introduce a
;  `+` procedure with another definition
;  Running this will lead to an time out error
